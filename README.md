A decision tree represents a function that takes as input a vector of attribute values and returns a decisionâ€”a single output value. A decision tree reaches its decision by performing a sequence of tests. Each internal node in the tree corresponds to a test of the value of one of the input attributes. Each leaf node in the tree specifies a value to be returned by the function.
The following program implements the decision tree algorithm using information gain as the importance function and prints the resulting decision tree. This project has been implemented in Java.
